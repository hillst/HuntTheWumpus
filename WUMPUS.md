#TODO
    -Map and WumpusMap are done, students are given these. maybe create another map type to play with.
    -Could be assignment operator and it could just be how the constructor is setting up the memory.
    -Wumpus game logic needs to be implemented as well.
    -One thing to keep in mind, right now "on enter" is being passed a player object. That is not particularly helpful.
    -Im interested in adding some function that loops over all the events in a room. This should be in room.

#Things unsure about:
    -Not sure big 3 for State work correctly

#TIMING
    -1 hr to do the Map and WumpusMAp (prob 5 mins for wumpus map)
    -30 mins for Room
    -30 mins for Evnet + BatEvent
    -1 hour debugging includes, class definitions, and various constructors
